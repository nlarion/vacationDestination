#Vacation Destination Suggester

####Answer a few questions and get a suggested vacation destination
####By: Neil Larion

## Description

###This is a project that takes user inputs using form and then returns a vacation suggestion to the user based on those inputs.

This project was developed during a "Code Review" session at Epicodus, which is a solo project designed to test our knowledge of the materials learned over the previous week's study. It's an honor to be apart of a coding community where people are genuinely interested in what they're doing. A link to the live site is provided below:
